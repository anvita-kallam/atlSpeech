# ARIMA Forecasting Analysis Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the ARIMA forecasting analysis performed on the Child Outcome data for % meeting 1, % meeting 3, and % meeting 6 metrics across all US states and territories for the years 2023 and 2024.

## Data Summary
- **Training Period**: 2018-2022 (5 years of historical data)
- **Forecast Period**: 2023-2024 (2 years ahead)
- **Total Forecasts Generated**: 165 state-metric combinations
- **States with Sufficient Data**: 55 states/territories

## Methodology

### ARIMA Model Selection
- **Parameter Search**: Tested all combinations of p (0-3), d (0-2), q (0-3) parameters
- **Model Selection**: Used AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) for optimal parameter selection
- **Stationarity Testing**: Applied Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to determine if differencing was needed
- **Special Cases**: Handled constant time series (all values identical) with ARIMA(0,0,0) models

### Data Quality
- Filtered out states with insufficient data (< 3 data points)
- Handled missing values appropriately
- Applied robust error handling for edge cases

## Key Findings

### % Meeting 1 (2023-2024 Forecasts)
- **Average 2023**: 92.40% (Range: -25.64% to 104.36%)
- **Average 2024**: 91.44% (Range: -34.59% to 102.63%)
- **Standard Deviation**: ~16-18% indicating high variability across states
- **Trend**: Slight decline from 2023 to 2024

### % Meeting 3 (2023-2024 Forecasts)
- **Average 2023**: 31.63% (Range: -28.14% to 87.30%)
- **Average 2024**: 35.40% (Range: -8.30% to 100.80%)
- **Standard Deviation**: ~25-28% indicating very high variability
- **Trend**: Slight improvement from 2023 to 2024

### % Meeting 6 (2023-2024 Forecasts)
- **Average 2023**: 34.22% (Range: -53.30% to 130.00%)
- **Average 2024**: 35.51% (Range: -106.60% to 150.00%)
- **Standard Deviation**: ~33-42% indicating extremely high variability
- **Trend**: Minimal change from 2023 to 2024

## Model Performance Insights

### Stationarity Analysis
- Most time series were non-stationary, requiring differencing (d > 0)
- Common ARIMA patterns: (2,2,0), (3,0,0), (2,1,0)
- Constant series (like Palau's % meeting 3) were handled with ARIMA(0,0,0)

### Confidence Intervals
- Narrow confidence intervals for stable metrics (e.g., % meeting 1)
- Wide confidence intervals for volatile metrics (e.g., % meeting 6)
- Some forecasts show extreme values, indicating model uncertainty

## Notable Forecasts

### High-Performing States (2024 % Meeting 1)
- Northern Marianas: 101.00%
- Massachusetts: 97.90%
- North Dakota: 97.90%

### Challenging States (2024 % Meeting 1)
- New Mexico: -34.59% (concerning negative forecast)
- Oklahoma: 88.30%

### Volatile Metrics
- % Meeting 6 shows the highest variability
- Some states show extreme forecasts (>100% or negative values)
- This suggests the need for additional data or alternative modeling approaches

## Recommendations

### For Data Quality
1. **Investigate Extreme Forecasts**: Review states with negative or >100% forecasts
2. **Additional Data**: Collect more historical data points for better model stability
3. **Outlier Detection**: Implement robust outlier handling for extreme values

### For Model Improvement
1. **Ensemble Methods**: Consider combining ARIMA with other forecasting methods
2. **External Variables**: Include economic, demographic, or policy variables
3. **State-Specific Models**: Develop customized models for different state characteristics

### For Interpretation
1. **Confidence Intervals**: Always present forecasts with uncertainty bounds
2. **Scenario Analysis**: Consider best-case, worst-case, and most-likely scenarios
3. **Regular Updates**: Re-run forecasts as new data becomes available

## Files Generated

1. **`arima_forecasts_original_format_*.csv`**: Complete dataset with forecasts in original format
2. **`arima_forecasts_detailed_*.csv`**: Detailed forecasts with confidence intervals and model parameters
3. **`arima_forecast_summary_*.csv`**: Summary statistics for all forecasts
4. **`arima_forecasting.py`**: Complete Python implementation
5. **`requirements.txt`**: Required Python packages

## Technical Notes

- **Model Validation**: Used AIC for model selection, which balances fit quality with complexity
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of edge cases and data quality issues
- **Reproducibility**: All code is well-documented and reproducible
- **Scalability**: Framework can be easily extended for additional metrics or time periods

## Conclusion

The ARIMA forecasting analysis provides valuable insights into expected trends for child outcome metrics across US states. While the models show varying degrees of confidence, they offer a data-driven foundation for planning and decision-making. The high variability in some metrics suggests the need for continued monitoring and model refinement as additional data becomes available.

**Key Takeaway**: The forecasts indicate generally stable performance for % meeting 1, but significant challenges and variability for % meeting 3 and % meeting 6, highlighting areas that may require focused attention and intervention strategies.
